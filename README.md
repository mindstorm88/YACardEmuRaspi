# YACardEmuRaspi
This repo is to keep track of what i needed to do to use YACardEmu with a Raspberry Pi 3+ in headless mode.

here is the official repo of YACardEmu https://github.com/GXTX/YACardEmu

The goal is to have a Raspberri Pi3+ stand alone , no screen, no kb, only 1 button to power up and power down to stanby mode.

Operating system :
After few struggle with RaspiOs it appear that the best os to build YACardEmu is Ubuntu, so i installed UBUNTU SERVER 22.04.3 LTS
